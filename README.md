*********" BRANCH "
A branch is a version of the repository that diverges from the main working project. 
Branches are a part of your everyday development process. Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. 
When we want to add a new feature or fix a bug, we spawn a new branch to summarize our changes.
